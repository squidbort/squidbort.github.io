##Cocktail Adventures 

In early June 2019, my wife and I moved into an apartment that finally allowed for dinner and game night parties. Once we had the first set of friends over, she got the idea that we needed to have a tiki party as soon as possible. This of course led me down the path of looking up complicated recipes for tiki cocktails with long ingredient lists and wild names whose recipes varried from one source to another. I decided to start a bit simpler and tried to recreate some of our favorite drinks from various bars we have gone to. 

I've slowly been building a collection of bottles beyond the few whiskeys I have had for years now. That list follows here.

##Bottle List

###Whiskey
*Old Overholt
*Sagamore Rye
*Four Roses Bourbon

###Tequila
*El Jimador
*Lunazol

###Gin
*New Amsterdam
*Gordon's London Dry

###Vodka
*Absolut

###Cordials
*St. Germain
*Creme de Violett
*Cointreau
*Martini & Rossi Dry Vermouth

###Bitters
*Angostura
*Bittermans Xocolatl Mole
*Vena's Bitter Charles (grapefruit bitters)


In addition to these bottles, I've been trying some infusions and interesting creations. In early July, my wife and I were up in Portland, ME visiting Vena's Fizz House where she had a delicious vodka drink called the Blushing Grapefruit. We took home an infusion kit containing dried grapefruit, cranberry, and cane sugar to make a replica of that drink at home. The bartender was even kind enough to include the recipe for us to attempt at home. We steeped the vodka in this infusion kit for three days, strained it out, and have been slowly sipping on it since! It did an incredible job in recreating the flavor of the drink in the bar itself. 

We also had friends over this past weekend who brought a plethora of treats themselves for us to munch on. Part of this was a large bag of ripe cherries that we barely made a dent into while they were visiting. In order to make sure these were used before going bad, I decided to make a shrub from them! The recipe was as follows:
*Make a simple syrup with 1 cup water and 1 cup cane sugar.
*Add 2 cups pitted cherries and slowly simmer until the syrup takes on the color of the cherries.
*Add 1 cup of white balsalmic vinegar and briefly simmer. 
*Strain and decant into a bottle for storage. Allow to cool before placing in the refrigerator.

Right now it is mellowing out in the firdge (it was VERY vinegar forward when I tasted it the following morning!) and I excited to experiment with it soon.
