title: Cantrip Cocktails: Chill Touch
---

This past week saw the start of two new campaigns where I get to be a player! This change of pace from being a DM has been great, and will hopefully allow me to have a bit of a break before getting back into the DM chair. I was being a little burnt out managing multiple campaigns, and am excited to learn through practice how a few other classes can be played. 

In one of these, a brand new DM is running the Forge of Fury from Tales from the Yawning Portal (set in Saltmarsh so we can bounch between TftYP and Ghosts of Saltmarsh), and I am playing Salthak, the Paladin of Vengeance devoted to to the sea queen Umberlee. He and his shipmate (Yoren the Tortle) were the only survivors of a desructive pirate attack and subsequent squid attack and he is now hell bent on seeking vengeance against the pirate who attacked them. In the second campaign (also with a brand new DM!) we're playing in an 80's horror campaign loosly based on the Death House intro adventure to Ravenloft. It's SUPER unique and fun (we fought a wraith flavored as a stoner who became one with his bong as the level 1 boss) and my first time playing a Bard, which is a total blast; I like being in more of a support role to let others shine.

While chatting during one of these games, the idea of creating or modifying new cocktail recipes around Dungeons and Dragons spells came up. I went ahead and attempted this with one particular cocktail/spell - Chill Touch!

Recipe to follow...
